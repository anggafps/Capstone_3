## Problem Statement
In the competitive landscape of online retail, customer retention is paramount. A leading e-commerce company is facing challenges in identifying customers who are likely to churn, which is when customers decide to stop engaging with the business. This churn not only leads to immediate loss of sales but also affects long-term revenue and brand loyalty. The ability to predict which customers are at risk of churning can enable the company to proactively engage them with targeted promotions or interventions, potentially saving the business significant revenue and sustaining customer relationships.

### Target Definition
In this context, the target variable is 'Churn', which is binary:

0 (Negative Class): Represents customers who are likely to continue their relationship with the company. These are the customers who are engaged, satisfied, and not at risk of ending their business with the e-commerce platform.
1 (Positive Class): Represents customers who are at risk of churning. These are individuals who, based on their engagement patterns, transaction history, and other behavioral factors, are likely to discontinue their purchases and interaction with the company.

### Goals
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning. By doing so, the company aims to:

Implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty.
Optimize marketing spend by focusing on high-risk customers.
Enhance customer satisfaction by addressing potential issues proactively.
Ultimately, reduce the churn rate and increase the customer lifetime value (CLV).

### Analytic Approach
The approach involves using historical customer data to train a machine learning model that can predict churn. The data includes various features such as customer demographics, transaction history, engagement metrics, and satisfaction scores. Techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting will be explored due to their ability to handle complex relationships within the data and provide insights into feature importance.

### Metric Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance, several metrics will be considered:

Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model in predicting churn.
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions in the positive class.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ability of the model to capture all actual churn cases.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two in cases of class imbalance.
AUC-ROC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, indicating the model's ability to discriminate between the classes.

### Error Types and Consequences
Type 1 Error (False Positive): Incorrectly predicting that a customer will churn when they will not. The consequence is potentially wasting resources on unnecessary retention efforts, which could also annoy or alienate customers who were not at risk.
Type 2 Error (False Negative): Failing to identify a customer at risk of churning. The consequence is more severe, as it results in the loss of a customer, along with their future revenue contribution, without any intervention attempt.
